# ENGR 010 Group Project - Computer Science Option
## Data Analysis and Pattern Recognition Platform
## Overview
In this group project, you will develop a Python-based data analysis platform that applies fundamental algorithms to real-world datasets. Your team will create an interactive application that performs various data processing tasks, identifies patterns, and presents findings through visualizations and reports. 

One important part of this project is the use of Generative AI tools like ChatGPT to complete the assignment. AI tools are going to become increasingly useful and more widely used in the job market you're headed into, and we want you to be prepared for it.  So, while you need to understand everything the AI creates on your behalf, for this assignment we are not only allowing you to use AI, we are requiring that you make use of it.  Let's see what amazing work you can create when you use AI as your personal assistant.
## Section 2: Project Description

### Background
Data analysis and pattern recognition are fundamental applications in computer science. Engineers and data scientists regularly work with datasets to extract meaningful insights and make informed decisions. This project simulates a simplified version of the tools used in professional practice.
### Project Specifications
Your team will create a Python application that:
1. Data Management
   - Imports data from various file formats (CSV, JSON, TXT)
   - Performs data cleaning and preprocessing
   - Stores and organizes datasets efficiently
   - Handles missing values and outliers
2. Analysis Features
   - Implements at least 3 of the following algorithms:
     * Clustering (e.g., basic k-means)
     * Classification (e.g., decision trees)
     * Regression analysis
     * Text analysis (word frequency, sentiment)
     * Network analysis
   - Calculates statistical metrics
   - Identifies patterns and correlations
   - Performs comparative analysis
3. Visualization Features
   - Static plots of data distributions
   - Correlation matrices
   - Trend analysis charts
   - Interactive dashboard for data exploration

### Sample Data
A sample dataset will be provided covering consumer purchasing patterns.
### Learning Objectives
- Apply fundamental Python programming concepts in a real-world context
- Gain experience with scientific computing libraries
- Develop skills in data visualization and analysis
- Practice collaborative software development
- Experiment with using Generative AI to assist with writing code, developing concepts, etc.
### Technical Requirements
Your project must implement the following Python concepts:
1. Variables and Data Types
   - Appropriate use of multiple data types
   - Clear and consistent variable naming
   - Use of constants where appropriate

2. Control Structures
   - Multiple if/elif/else decision structures
   - At least two different types of loops (for, while)
   - Error handling using try/except

3. Functions and Organization
   - Minimum of 5 custom functions
   - Proper use of parameters and return values
   - Documentation using docstrings
   - Code organization into multiple Python files

4. Data Structures
   - Lists for storing sequential data
   - Dictionaries for storing key-value pairs
   - Implementation of basic data structures (arrays, trees)

5. Scientific Computing
   - Statistical analysis using NumPy
   - Data manipulation using Pandas
   - At least 3 different types of plots using Matplotlib
   - Basic computational complexity analysis

6. Creativity 
   - Please add some fun or interesting features to your application to make it your own. Lean on AI to do this if you aren't sure what to do beyond what we have learned in class. For example, you could make your project into a web app instead of a notebook, try using a different library for visualizations, or add some own sample data of your own to do another type of visualization / analysis. 
   - Whatever you decide to do, be creative and have fun with it! 

### Submission Requirements
1. Jupyter Notebook File Submission
   - Code used to complete project
   - Written descriptions that complement code and explain thought process (similar to Engineering Assignments)
   - If you want to turn in your code in a different format - i.e. a bunch of python files - that is absolutely allowed but not required.

2. Progress Reports
   - Two progress reports (templates in Section 3)
   - Due at weeks 9 and 12 of the semester

3. AI Prompts with Annotations
   - You should also submit any and all prompts to ChatGPT or other Gen-AI systems (e.g. Claude, Gemini, etc.) that you used for this project
   - Please annotate each prompt with a short description that describes your thought process for that inquiry. Some potential things to write about in those annotations:
      - Why did you ask AI that question? 
      - Did AI answer the question you asked well? How do you know? (e.g. the answer matches what we learned in the class on loops)
      - If you updated a prompt after getting an unsatisfactory answer, what was your thought process for the updated prompt?

4. Reflection on using AI for programming
   - Did you enjoy using AI to help with this project? 
   - What type of questions/prompts did AI work well for? What about things it didn't do well?
   - Did using AI save you time?
   - Were the concepts used in the AI-generated code things that you already had seen and understood? If not, why did you decide to use them in your final project? 

5. Final Presentation
   - 5-minute demonstration
   - Short Q&A
   - All team members must participate
